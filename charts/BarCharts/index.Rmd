# Interactive BarCharts Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to create interactive barcharts like the one below using a variety of different libraries, currently including; plotly and highchart. Note that there is currently one interactive shiny app associated with this tutorial:

- [Interactive BarCharts with htmlwidgets](https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/htmlwidget_template_BarCharts)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(highcharter)
desktopItems <- read.csv(file = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5360960")
measure_column <- "Desktop.Items"
categories <- c("Operating.System","University.Department","University","Country")
selected_dimension <- categories[1]
aggregate_number_of_observations <- aggregate(data = desktopItems, eval(as.name(measure_column)) ~ eval(as.name(selected_dimension)), FUN = length)
colnames(aggregate_number_of_observations) <- c(selected_dimension,"Desktop.Items")
aggregate_number_of_observations <- aggregate_number_of_observations[order(aggregate_number_of_observations$Desktop.Items),]
format_label <- function(dimension){
  gsub(pattern = "[.]", replacement = " ", x = dimension)
}
highchart(height = 200) %>%
  hc_chart(type = "bar") %>%
  hc_xAxis(categories = aggregate_number_of_observations[,selected_dimension]) %>%
  hc_add_series(name = format_label(selected_dimension), data = rev(aggregate_number_of_observations[,measure_column])) %>%
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Mean Number of Desktop Items")) %>%
  hc_title(text = paste0("Mean number of desktop items aggregated by ",format_label(selected_dimension)))
```

The datasets that this tutorial considers are structured as follows:

```{r example_df, echo=FALSE}
example_df <- data.frame(
  "Measure" = 1:3,
  "Category 1" = c("A","B","A"),
  "Category 2" = c("X","Y","Y")
)
knitr::kable(example_df)
```

Where the "measure" column contains numerical data which is categorised by a number of categories (or *dimensions*). There are therefore two interesting bar charts that can be generated:

- The mean value of the measure broken down by a particular category (Mean Parameter per Category)
- The number of observations broken down by a particular category (Number of Observations per Category)

Note that this template covers both how to build such a bar chart inside of an HTML RMarkdown file and how to functionalise the code so as to conveniently switch between different categories and metrics in a Shiny app.

# Import and Clean Data

The data for this template is a .csv file accessed from Figshare [here](https://figshare.com/articles/Investigation_into_the_number_of_desktop_items_on_University_staff_computers_broken_down_by_department_and_operating_system_/3425729) using `read.csv`.

```{r import_data}
desktopItems <- read.csv(file = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5360960")
knitr::kable(head(desktopItems))
```

An advanced version of this template might attempt to automatically infer the measure and appropriate categories for the data, in this template we explicitly decide which columns are categories (or dimensions) and which column is the measure:

```{r define_columns, echo=TRUE}
measure_column <- "Desktop.Items"
categories <- c("Operating.System","University.Department","University","Country")
```

These columns will be used in the BarCharts to decide what dimensions of the data we are visualising.

# Mean Parameter per Category

Using the `aggregate` function the mean number of desktop items per category can easily be calculated, the chosen category for aggregation will be assigned to `selected_dimension`. The function `as.name` is necessary to convert strings into valid column names.
The first 'eval' computes the mean of the measure column values. The second 'evel' computes the value of the selected column.

```{r mean_aggregate}
selected_dimension <- categories[1]
aggregate_mean <- aggregate(data = desktopItems, eval(as.name(measure_column)) ~ eval(as.name(selected_dimension)), FUN = mean)
knitr::kable(aggregate_mean)
```

For convenience in the visualisation, the column names of the `data.frame` are renamed:

```{r mean_rename}
colnames(aggregate_mean) <- c(selected_dimension, measure_column)
```

The column names for the categories are formatted with periods instead of spaces, i.e. Operating.System which does not aid comprehension of the chart. Using `gsub` a utility function called `format_label` is created to replace the periods:

```{r}
format_label <- function(dimension){
  gsub(pattern = "[.]", replacement = " ", x = dimension)
}
```

## Highcharter

The `data.frame` can now be visualised using `highcharter` as follows, note that it is unnecessary to use `eval` with this library as a namespace is not defined within the context of the visualisation.

```{r}
library(highcharter)
highchart() %>%
  hc_chart(type = "column") %>%
  hc_xAxis(categories = aggregate_mean[,selected_dimension]) %>%
  hc_add_series(name = format_label(selected_dimension), data = aggregate_mean[,measure_column]) %>%
  hc_title(text = paste0("Mean number of desktop items aggregated by ",format_label(selected_dimension)))
```


The `highcharter` library distinguishes between horizontal and vertically orientated bar charts by `hc_chart(type = )`; column and bar are verticle and horizontal, respectively. Both varieties of chart are more legible if bars are ordered from largest to smallest, note that internal to `hc_add_series` the ordered `measure_column` is reversed to achieve this:

```{r}
aggregate_mean <- aggregate_mean[order(aggregate_mean$Desktop.Items),]
highchart() %>%
  hc_chart(type = "bar") %>%
  hc_xAxis(categories = aggregate_mean[,selected_dimension]) %>%
  hc_add_series(name = format_label(selected_dimension), data = rev(aggregate_mean[,measure_column])) %>%
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Mean Number of Desktop Items")) %>%
  hc_title(text = paste0("Mean number of desktop items aggregated by ",format_label(selected_dimension)))
```


## Plotly

The `data.frame` can now be visualised using `Plotly` as follows, note that `eval` is necessary as the `x` and `y` arguments are assumed to be explicit column names for the `data` provided to `plotly` - `eval` forces the evaluation of `as.name(selected_dimension)`.

```{r}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(data = aggregate_mean,
        type = "bar",
        x = eval(as.name(selected_dimension)),
        y = eval(as.name(measure_column))) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = format_label(selected_dimension)),
         yaxis = list(title = "Mean Number of Desktop Items"),
         title = paste0("Mean number of desktop items aggregated by ",format_label(selected_dimension)))
```

Barcharts are verticle by default in the plotly library, however horizontally orientated bar charts are often more appropriate where dimension labels are long. Independent of orientation, bar charts are more legible if bars are ordered from largest to smallest, as show below. Orientation is controlled in the `plotly` library through the argument `orientation`:

```{r}
aggregate_mean <- aggregate_mean[order(aggregate_mean$Desktop.Items),]
plot_ly(data = aggregate_mean,
        type = "bar",
        y = eval(as.name(selected_dimension)),
        x = eval(as.name(measure_column)),
        orientation = "h") %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Mean Number of Desktop Items"),
         yaxis = list(title = format_label(selected_dimension)),
         title = paste0("Mean number of desktop items aggregated by ",format_label(selected_dimension)),
         margin = list(l = 80))
```


# Number of Observations per Category

The number of observations per category can be calculated with `aggregate` by applying the `FUN` length across the subset data - i.e. how long is the list of observations for each category. 

```{r noObservations_aggregate}
aggregate_number_of_observations <- aggregate(data = desktopItems, eval(as.name(measure_column)) ~ eval(as.name(selected_dimension)), FUN = length)
colnames(aggregate_number_of_observations) <- c(selected_dimension,"Desktop.Items")
```

## Highcharter

Using the same code as above, a barchart of the aggregated data can easily be generated:

```{r}
aggregate_number_of_observations <- aggregate_number_of_observations[order(aggregate_number_of_observations$Desktop.Items),]
highchart() %>%
  hc_chart(type = "bar") %>%
  hc_xAxis(categories = aggregate_number_of_observations[,selected_dimension]) %>%
  hc_add_series(name = format_label(selected_dimension), data = rev(aggregate_number_of_observations[,measure_column])) %>%
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Mean Number of Desktop Items")) %>%
  hc_title(text = paste0("Mean number of desktop items aggregated by ",format_label(selected_dimension)))
```


## Plotly

Using the same code as above, a barchart of the aggregated data can easily be generated:

```{r}
aggregate_number_of_observations <- aggregate_number_of_observations[order(aggregate_number_of_observations$Desktop.Items),]
plot_ly(data = aggregate_number_of_observations,
        type = "bar",
        y = eval(as.name(selected_dimension)),
        x = eval(as.name(measure_column)),
        orientation = "h") %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Number of respondants"),
         yaxis = list(title= format_label(selected_dimension)),
         title = paste0("Number of respondants aggregated by ",format_label(selected_dimension)),
         margin = list(l = 80))
```

# Functionalising 

It is convenient to proceduralise the creation of these charts by converting the scripts into functions that can easily be called with different parameters, this is particularly useful for in Shiny apps. A function for each charting library considered in this document is provided below.

Note that the aggregation function is the same, for this tutorial, regardless of the visualisation library used.

```{r}
aggregate_data_for_barchart <-
  function(data = NA,
           dimension_column = NA,
           measure_column = NA,
           aggregate_function = NA) {
    aggregated_data <-
      aggregate(data = data,
                eval(as.name(measure_column)) ~ eval(as.name(dimension_column)),
                FUN = aggregate_function)
    colnames(aggregated_data) <- c(dimension_column, measure_column)
    
    aggregated_data <-
      aggregated_data[order(aggregated_data[, measure_column]), ]
    # Return for use
    aggregated_data
  }
```

This function can easily be called to aggregate the data as follows:

```{r}
intermediate_aggregate <- aggregate_data_for_barchart(
  data = desktopItems,
  dimension_column = "University",
  measure_column = "Desktop.Items",
  aggregate_function = mean
)
knitr::kable(intermediate_aggregate)
```

## Plotly

The function below is used to generate a plotly bar chart from the aggregate data function, note that a number of additional arguments have been added to provide greater flexibility over the output.

```{r}
plotly_aggregated_barchart <- function(
  data = NA,
  dimension_column = NA,
  measure_column = NA,
  aggregate_description = NA,
  left_margin = 100,
  displayFurniture = T
) {
  plot_ly(
    data = data,
    type = "bar",
    y = eval(as.name(dimension_column)),
    x = Desktop.Items,
    orientation = "h"
  ) %>%
    layout(
      xaxis = list(title = aggregate_description),
      yaxis = list(title = ""),
      title = paste0(
        aggregate_description," aggregated by ",
        format_label(dimension_column)
      ),
      margin = list(l = left_margin)
    ) %>%
    config(displayModeBar = displayFurniture)
}
```

For example:

```{r}
plotly_aggregated_barchart(
  data = intermediate_aggregate,
  dimension_column = "University",
  measure_column = "Desktop.Items",
  aggregate_description = "Mean number of desktop items",
  displayFurniture = F
)
```


## Highcharter

The function below is used to generate a highcharter bar chart from the aggregate data function, note that a number of additional arguments have been added to provide greater flexibility over the output.


```{r}
highcharter_aggregated_barchart <- function(
  data = NA,
  dimension_column = NA,
  measure_column = NA,
  aggregate_description = NA
) {
  highchart() %>%
  hc_chart(type = "bar") %>%
  hc_xAxis(categories = data[,dimension_column]) %>%
  hc_add_series(name = format_label(dimension_column), data = rev(aggregate_number_of_observations[,measure_column])) %>%
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = aggregate_description)) %>%
  hc_title(text = paste0(aggregate_description," of desktop items aggregated by ",format_label(dimension_column)))
}
```

For example:

```{r}
highcharter_aggregated_barchart(
  data = intermediate_aggregate,
  dimension_column = "University",
  measure_column = "Desktop.Items",
  aggregate_description = "Mean number of desktop items"
)
```

# Shiny App

A shiny app containing an interactive version of the charts above is available here: <a href="https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/htmlwidget_template_BarCharts/">https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/htmlwidget_template_BarCharts/</a>.

The following types of interaction are supported:

- Switch between different visualisation libraries
